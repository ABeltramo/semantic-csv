## 0.1.0-alpha2

* Removed `cast-all` in favor of `cast-with` forking behaviour on whether first arg is a map or not.
* Smarter error handling options in `cast-with`.
* Added `except-first` macro for processing pipelines where some processing should occur on all lines but the first
  (useful for leaving headers unmodified).
* Renamed `:ignore-first` option of `cast-with` to `:except-first` to remain more consistent with above.
* Added `:header` opt to mappify, which uses specified vector as a header row, preventing consumption of first row for the same.
* For consistency with above, renamed `:header` arg in processing function to `:mappify`, and added `:header` arg which
  passes through to `mappify`.
* Greatly improved testing coverage, with thanks to @ballPointPenguin.
* Snappier `structify` version of `mappify` with 5x performance characteristics, with thanks to @MichaelBlume
* Added `->double` and `->long` functions to complement `->int` and `->float`, with thanks to @JonyEpsilon.
* Safer `->double`, `->long`, `->int` and `->float` functions that don't choke when passed numbers or strings with spaces.
